the the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
the cites the the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem 
Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 the "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
(The Extremes the Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
